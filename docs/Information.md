## Information

Primary functions of the tool:

- Assignment of URN:NBN identifiers in exchange for the metadata of identified documents. An assignment is performed automatically via the communication API or manually through the web interface.
- Administration of persistent identifiers and associated metadata 
- Registration and updating of URL addresses of digital documents with an already assigned URN:NBN identifier
- Resolver, a system that provides information on an object´s current location (the URL of the document and its associated metadata)
- Management of user accounts, access rights  and registrar records (including digital libraries and registrar catalogs) via the web interface
- Access to required records via the web interface
- Initiation of server-side processes through the web interface (OAI Adapter, the export of a list of identifiers)
- Uses the OAI-PMH protocol to harvest metadata from external systems

Development: 

CZIDLO was developed in 2011-2012. This software solution is based on open-source technologies (Java, PostgreSQL database, Spring Security, GWT) and recognized standards (XML, XSD, XSLT, HTTP, REST).

CZIDLO ensures permanent access to digital documents despite changes in URL addresses. It provides synchronization among derivatives of digital documents across systems and allows verification of a citation. 
Thus, it ensures: 1. Access to documents; 2. Synchronization across systems; and 3. Verification of citations.
